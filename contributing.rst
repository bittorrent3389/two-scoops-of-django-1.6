Before You Submit an Issue
===========================

* Be nice. :-)
* Be honest.
* Check the other issues to see if this issue already exists.
* Please identify each issue by page number, chapter, and section/subsection numbers.
* For tracking and credit purposes, each request for correction needs to be in it's own issue. We hate to do this, but if an issue contains 2 or more issues, we'll close it with a request for breaking up into more atomic issues.
